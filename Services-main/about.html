          <p>
            HELPABLE is a registered NDIS provider supporting individuals living
            with disabilities to achieve their goals and live fulfilling lives
            through individualized, local, community-based support. Our
            organization is committed to ensuring that the people we support
            have the opportunity to participate in activities that enable them
            to enhance, fulfill, and demonstrate a valued role in their
            community. For years, we have been putting people at the center of
            everything we do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our belief is that we all belong. We are all peas from the same pod!
          </p>

          <h2>Individualized Services</h2>
          <p>
            Working together, we focus on your interests, personal goals, and
            what you need from us. We know there is no one-size-fits-all ‚Äì age,
            gender, culture, heritage, language, faith, sexual identity,
            relationship status ‚Äì at HELPABLE we celebrate our differences and
            work with you to create services that are individually tailored to
            your strengths, needs, and preferences.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Life. Your Choices. Your Way.</h2>
          <p>
            Our aim is to remove barriers and encourage active choice and
            decision-making. After all, this is all about you. Your life, your
            choices, your way. We believe disability is caused by the way that
            society is organized, rather than a person‚Äôs impairment or
            difference. We subscribe to a social model, designed to remove
            barriers. Our employees don‚Äôt wear uniforms to encourage people in
            the community to see the person first, rather than their disability.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Neighborhoods</h2>
          <p>
            HELPABLE Neighborhoods are founded on real connections and
            meaningful relationships within your community. With Support Teams,
            we can work together with the people you trust ‚Äì family, friends,
            and other NDIS supports, on building a whole support network around
            you.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Fleet</h2>
          <p>
            We have a fleet of more than 75 vehicles, including 40 with
            wheelchair access transporting the people we support from home to
            work, school, and community activities. Our supports at HELPABLE are
            mainly one on one so we can focus on you and do what we do best -
            supporting people to live a good life!
          </p>
